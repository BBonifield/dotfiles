# dotfiles

Big thanks to [@holman](https://github.com/holman) for [the inspiration](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) to help others organize their dotfiles. And many thanks to [@bbonifield](https://github.com/bbonifield) for getting me to be sane about my config

## Pre-reqs

- Xcode from the App Store (necessary for MacVim)
- [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
- [janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus)
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), accessible from vim with alias `<leader>gh`

## Installation

Assuming you have the pre-reqs, `script/install` will get everything setup.

## Periodic Updating

Things change over time, so run `upgrade-dotfiles` to pull in the latest
and greatest.
