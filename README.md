# the dots

Big thanks to @holman for [the
inspiration/framework](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles).  I took what he did
and modified it for my purposes.

## Pre-reqs

- Xcode from the App Store (necessary for MacVim)
- [ohmyzsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
- [janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus)

## Installation

Assuming you have the pre-reqs, `script/install` will get everything setup.

## Periodic Updating

Things change over time, so run `upgrade-dotfiles` to pull in the latest
and greatest.
